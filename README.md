# Security-Onion-Lab

## Objective
  
This lab emphasizes the practical application of security monitoring techniques such as log collection, network traffic analysis, and intrusion detection. I was able to gain more hands-on experience with simulating real-world cyberattacks and defending against them within the setup using a KALI Linux machine to simulate attacks against a Windows User. By the end of the lab I felt even more comfortable configuring key tools to detect, analyze, and respond to security events.
