# Security-Onion-Lab

## Objective
  
This lab emphasizes the practical application of security monitoring techniques such as log collection, network traffic analysis, and intrusion detection. I was able to gain more hands-on experience with simulating real-world cyberattacks and defending against them within the setup using a KALI Linux machine to simulate attacks against a Windows User. By the end of the lab I felt even more comfortable configuring key tools to detect, analyze, and respond to security events.

## Skills Learned

* Designed and configured a home lab using virtualization technologies (Virtualbox, VMware), gaining practical hands-on experience

 * Deployed and secured various operating systems (Windows, Linux) and servers, enhancing technical skills

* Used Active Directory domain services to create certificates and promote the server to a domain controller 

* Collected and analyzed network traffic logs from Security Onion in Splunk, practicing correlating alerts with specific incidents and threat patterns
